# Her Boutique

This project called HerBoutique and it uses Searchspring's API to display a variety of products. Users have the option to browse all the available products, add any items they like to their cart, filter products by categories, and sort them either alphabetically or by price, in ascending or descending order. Additionally, users can search for specific items using the search bar and navigate through different pages with the help of the pagination bar. The app is designed to be accessible and user-friendly on both desktop and mobile devices.
